    <p><b>Advantages:</b> Cassava thrives in marginal soils, tolerates drought, produces high-yielding roots, and resists major diseases. It provides food security, versatile industrial use, and sustainable income streams. Intercropping with other crops improves soil fertility and farm productivity, making it ideal for smallholder and commercial farmers.</p>
    <p><b>Cultivation:</b> Plant disease-free stems in loose, well-drained soils with 1m spacing. Apply NPK and organic fertilizers, mulch for moisture retention, and intercropping with legumes enhances soil nitrogen. Regular weeding and pest monitoring ensures healthy growth.</p>
    <p><b>Harvesting & Yield:</b> Harvest 9–12 months after planting. Roots yield 20–35 tons/ha depending on soil and management. Careful digging prevents damage. Stems can be stored for replanting, and roots should be processed promptly to maintain quality.</p>
    <p><b>Economic Benefits:</b> Cassava supports multiple revenue streams: food staples, flour, garri, starch, animal feed, and bioethanol. Provides employment and strengthens local economies. Smallholders and large farms can profit from consistent market demand.</p>
    <p><b>Challenges:</b> Vulnerable to pests like green mites, diseases, soil degradation, and labor-intensive management. Market fluctuations and poor storage can affect income. Requires integrated pest management and proper farming practices.</p>
    <p><b>Uses:</b> Roots for fufu, garri, flour; leaves as vegetables; industrial applications include starch and bioethanol. Supports food security, income generation, and raw material supply for industries.</p>
